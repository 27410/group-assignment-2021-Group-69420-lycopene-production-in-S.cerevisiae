# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 69420: Lycopene production in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*

## Project summary
The aim of this project is to introduce a heterologous biosynthetic pathway for the production of lycopene in a currently existing GSM of *S. cerevisiae*. In this report, we propose a sustainable  engineering strategy for producing/optimizing the production of lycopene in *S. cerevisiae* by using computational methods to modify the GSM model. These include media optimization, knockout and upregulation of genes, phenotypic phase plane analysis, and co-factor swapping, as well as incorporating a heterologous precursor pathway from bacteria.

## Project overview
* Our project is organized into different folders and notebooks. 
* Our analysis of the GSM is in the numbered notebooks in the main folder.
* The report is in the Report.ipynb notebook and contains links to the analysis notebooks in the main folder.
* Pictures used in the report are stored in the folder __images__
* Files used for model assessment is found in the folder __model assessment__
* The models are found in the __models__ folder
* The MEP analysis is found in the __MEP_pathway__ folder
