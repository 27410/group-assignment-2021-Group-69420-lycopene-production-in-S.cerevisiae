# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 69420: Lycopene production in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*

> Dear students, thank you for accepting the group assignment. Please fill in the
> requested information below and above ([Group Number] and [TITLE]) and remove this quoted part before submission (everything prepended with a >).
> Please also replace `[PUT-YOUR-REPOSITORY-HERE]` up in the first line ðŸ‘† with the name of your repository here on GitHub.
> That way someone can click on the Binder badge icon and open your project in Jupyter lab to explore it.
> For this to work you will also have to keep `requirements.txt` up to date (by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
> Furthermore, this will only work if you decide to make your repository public (which you can do under Settings -> Options),
> which I would encourage you to do â€“ up to you. A lot of good science happens out in the open these days.
> Good luck!

## Project summary (<300 words)
The aim of this project is to introduce a heterologous biosynthetic pathway for the production of lycopene in a currently existing GSM of S. cerevisiae. In this report, we propose a sustainable  engineering strategy for producing/optimizing the production of lycopene in S. cerevisiae via using computational methods to modify the GSM model. These include overexpression of limiting enzymes in the pathway, knockout or downregulation of certain genes, increasing NADPH generation synthesis, and bioprospecting lycopene biosynthetic genes from multiple origins to improve catalytic activities.

A summary of what we achieved in this project:

1. Performed media optimization that improvedâ€¦.
2. Computed gene knockout strategies improved...
3. Computed gene upregulation strategies improvedâ€¦
